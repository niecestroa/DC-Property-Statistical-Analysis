# Bayesian Analysis Using R JAGS

## Overview
This project presents a Bayesian statistical analysis conducted using **R JAGS**.  
The analysis focuses on modeling real-world data using Bayesian inference, emphasizing posterior estimation, convergence diagnostics, and interpretation of results.

The full project report is provided as a PDF and documents the methodology, modeling decisions, and findings in detail.
